# CoproCalcuLalia - Insults You While Testing Maths  

## Just like that teacher you had!  

### A program designed to test times tables up to 15, and insult the user (random from a list) on input.  
  
I wanted a way to test my times tables up to 15, so I made a python project to accomplish my aim.  
This program uses Numpy and Python 3.8. I recommend the use of virtual environments when installing numpy.  
You can use Conda (Mini/Ana) to do this. 

I am a new programmer and welcome feedback.  



### FAQ  

> I got the question right, but the calculator insulted me anyway!  
This is intended functionality.  
  
> I have a rare insult that I want put in CoproCalcuLalia!  
Code it in and make a pull request, I'll consider it. I'm aiming for a very particular tone so don't get antsy if I don't put any/all of yours in.  

> Please can we add in a print of the correct answer/a question skip if we enter X wrong tries?  
No, that is deliberately left out. You can use a calculator or chart if you can't get the answer right; you're much more likely to remember the right answer when you've made at least some form of effort to get it.  

> Why in God's name would you make such a thing?  
For clues I refer you to Chapter 1 of Mr. Vonnegut's lovely book Breakfast of Champions. If that's not to hand: I did it as a learning project, and because it amused me. I hope it will amuse and inform similarly peurile minds all around the world.  
  
Thanks,
